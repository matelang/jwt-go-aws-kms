# AWS KMS adapter for golang-jwt/jwt-go library
This library provides an AWS KMS(Key Management Service) adapter to be used with the popular GoLang JWT library
[golang-jwt/jwt-go](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt).

It will *Sign* a JWT token using an asymmetric key stored in AWS KMS.

Verification can be done both using KMS *Verify* method or locally with a cached public key (default).
