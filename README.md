# AWS KMS adapter for dgrijalva/jwt-go library

This library provides an AWS KMS(Key Management Service) adapter to be used with the popular GoLang JWT library 
[dgrijalva/jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go).

It will *Sign* a JWT token using an assymetric key stored in AWS KMS.

Verification can be done both using KMS *Verify* method or locally with a cached public key (default).
